As a "thank you" to all the thousands of users who supported QuadSpinner in its infancy, we have open sourced our material, MetaNode, and function library under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

### [Realism in Vue - Open Sourced for the community](https://github.com/QuadSpinner/RealismInVue)
This version of the book has been open sourced to provide educational purposes by the author. This book was published nearly a decade ago, so please keep in mind that the software Vue has changed in some ways, and certain obsolete methodology may not apply. However, the core concepts still hold true.
